    p("General Circulation Models (GMCs) are used to depict how climate processes respond to the composition of various gases in the atmosphere.
      Using future projections of the composition of gases in the atmosphere, projections of future climate can be made.
      For this work, the GCMs provide different projections of future climate that are used to inform projections of future fire activity.
      If you are interested in exploring the range of burned area with these GCMs,
      the GFDL-CM3 and NCAR-CCSM4 models tend to correspond to the projections with the most area burned
      and the MRI-CGCM3 tends to have the least area burned. For more information, please see the following link."),

      about human population growth and economic development. In particular, economic development associated with energy usage 
      (e.g. how much and from what sources) is an important driver of future climate.
      We consider 3 RCPs here (4.5, 6.0, and 8.5). RCP 4.5 represents an aggressive reduction 
      in the emission of greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane. 
      RCP 8.5 represents significant increases in the population and a continuation of the use of energy sources
      that emit large quantities of green house gases. 
      RCP 6.0 lies somewhere in between."),
