## fireSizePlot.R

`fireSizePlot.R` stores the function `fireSizePlot`, which plots the distribution of maximum fire size events over the burnable ALFRESCO conditional on a fixed period of time.
The plot includes lines representing the historically observed maximum fire size and mean and 95% confidence interval among simulation replicates.

This plot is called in `AlfrescoCalibration.R` and currently is hardcoded to plot curves based on 1950 - 2011.

## R code

```{r fireSizePlot}
```
