## CABvsFSPlot.R

`CABvsFSPlot.R` stores the function `CABvsFSPlot`, which plots curves of cumulative burn area over the burnable ALFRESCO domain by fire size event conditional on a fixed period of time.
A curve is plotted for each simulation replicate.
The plot includes an overlay curve representing the historically observed cumulative burn area by historically observed fire event size.

This plot is called in `AlfrescoCalibration.R` and currently is hardcoded to plot curves based on 1950 - 2011.

## R code

```{r CABvsFSPlot}
