## clim_resample_2km_1km.R

The `clim_resample_2km_1km.R` script resamples 2-km resolution climate data sets to 1-km resolution for eventual inclusion into ALFRESCO modeling.
Nearest neighbor is used since it is much more efficient given the amount of data to be resampled and,
due to the use case, resampling using bilinear interpolation is not particularly useful, beneficial, or required.

## R code

```{r setup}
```
