## CABvsTimePlot.R

`CABvsTimePlot.R` stores the function `CABvsTimePlot`, which plots curves of cumulative burn area over the burnable ALFRESCO domain by time.
A curve is plotted for each simulation replicate.
The plot includes an overlay curve representing the historically observed cumulative burn area by time.

This plot is called in `AlfrescoCalibration.R` and currently is hardcoded to plot curves based on 1950 - 2011.

## R code

```{r CABvsTimePlot}
```
