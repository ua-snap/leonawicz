### Noatak shrub fire size log-normality

Evaluate the degree of log-normality of shrub fire size distributions using observed data and modeled outputs for the Noatak region.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
```

#### Function for log-normality assessment

```{r func_check_lnorm}
```

#### Observed and sample replicate simulation fire sizes

The first replicate was selected.

```{r lnorm_noa_shrub_all}
```

#### Observed and sample replicate simulation fire sizes by decade

The first replicate was selected.

```{r lnorm_noa_shrub_decades}
```
