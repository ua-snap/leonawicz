This project represents a rapid, rush production of various tables and graphs intended for the land carbon project.
Figures make use of historical and projected ALFRESCO model fire and vegetation output.
Two global climate models are used: CCCMAcgcm31 and MPIecham5.
The spatial domains considered include Alaska and five LCC regions within Alaska.
The material included here are highly preliminary.
