# SNAP Data Downscaling

## Introduction

Here you will find **R** code used to downscale climate data sets at SNAP.
These pages are a work in progress.
Currently, they only include raw **R** code and not much else in the way of commentary.

Also, these pages are incomplete.
The code related to the more preparatory stages dealing with climatology and anomaly calculation has thorough coverage,
but the actual end-stage downscaling code currently available here is only in relation to CRU 2.0 10-minute resolution downscaling.
Post-processing code related to calculation of summary statistics and creation of other derived data products is not included at all at this time.

A thorough code flow diagram will be added, as seen on my other Github project pages,
once the remainder of downscaling-related code has been including in these pages.
