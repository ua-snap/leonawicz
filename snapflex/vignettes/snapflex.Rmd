`snapflex` provides functions and templates for generating local flexdashboards showcasing and summarizing SNAP data sets as well as functions for accessing existing popular SNAP flexdashboards hosted online.

## Available templates

Before creating flexdashboards for SNAP climate data, it is necessary to know what flexdashboard templates are available. This can be done with `flex_templates`.

```{r templates}
library(snapflex)
flex_templates()
```

*The package is in early development so the list is scant at the moment.*

The table displays useful information about each template:


* the template ID used for generating a local flexdashboard.
* a brief description of the template.
* the variables included in the flexdashboard.
* whether any variables are displayed as deltas in comparison to a baseline rather than as raw values.
* intra- and/or inter-annual time period information if applicable.
* whether Shiny is used at runtime to launch a local instance of an interactive flexdashboard rather than a standalone html document.
* whether the template requires any additional parameters specified by the user.

## User specifications

Regarding the last item on the above list, templates allow limited user customization.
For example, all templates allow global plot settings for the plot theme and font attributes to be changed from their template-specific defaults via `snaptheme`, `gfont`, `regular` and `bold`. `gfont` sets the [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) and `regular` and `bold` take numeric weights.

Beyond these general optional parameters, each template may require additional unique parameters. These cannot be ignored like the optional ones. They do not have default settings and rely on the user to choose their values.
For example, a flexdashboard template for climate trends at a point location may require the user to provide a specific location from a list of available options so that the template can be used for more than a single, hard-coded location.
The row in `flex_templates()` pertaining to the `psc1` template for projected seasonal climate at a point location shows `TRUE` under the `params` column. This means that this template requires user-specified parameters.
It would show `FALSE` if only optional parameters were available.
Use `flex_params` with the template ID to see what is required.

```{r params}
flex_params(template = "psc1")
```

`flex_params` returns a data frame as above for any given template ID. The first column gives parameter names. The second gives their default values. If `NA`, it is a required parameter and must be provided by the user when rendering a flexdashboard template.
In this case there is only one required parameter: location. Having this information makes it possible to now use this template with `flex`, which returns an error if any required parameter is not provided.
The third column show hints that provide some context or description of what is considered a valid value for each parameter in case you are not familiar with the underlying SNAP data or flexdashboard template.

## Creating flexdashboards

The central function in `snapflex` that creates and populates flexdashboards from templates and SNAP climate data sets is `flex`.
Specify `out_dir` in `flex` if you want to save flexdashboards somewhere other than your working directory.

```{r flex}
pars <- list(location = "Anchorage")
flex(template = "psc1", template_params = pars)
```

This will create a flexdashboard using `rmarkdown` and save it to `out_dir`. Click the image to view the flexdashboard result.

Some templates use Shiny runtime and launch in your web browser as an app. For these templates, there is no static HTML document saved to `out_dir`.

Remember that `snapflex` is part of the [SNAPverse](https://leonawicz.github.io/snapverse/). It is for showcasing SNAP data sets. If using `snapflex` it is important to have a more general familiarity with the SNAPverse. Specifically, it is important in the example above to know that available point locations associated with SNAP climate data are part of the `snaplocs` package. `flex_params` provides this hint, but generally speaking, success using SNAPverse packages correlates with the level of familiarity you have with the verse and the SNAP data sets it wraps around.

## Optional parameters

Recreating the above dashboard using different values for optional parameters can be done like in the following example.

```{r optional_params, eval=FALSE}
pars <- list(location = "Anchorage", gfont = "Source Sans Pro", regular = 300, bold = 400, snaptheme = "theme_snapdark")
flex(template = "psc1", template_params = pars)
```

### flex_dashboard arguments

The `...` argument can be used to pass a list of arguments directly to `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` for additional control over the structure and appearance of template output.
Common arguments include `theme`, `css` and `storyboard`. See the [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) package for more information.

### Storyboards

Any template can be alternatively rendered as a storyboard-style flexdashboard. However, not all templates are intended for use this way, so mileage may vary.
Some templates are dual-designed to support both formats. For example, the `rsds1` template provides four plots in a standard layout which little additional information.
This is useful if you already know what you are looking at. If `storyboard = TRUE`, the template will be rendered to a storyboard.
This provides additional textual summaries for each plot that are not part of the standard, simplified layout. It also allows for larger display of individual plots.

```{r storyboards, eval=FALSE}
pars <- list(location = "Vancouver")
flex(template = "rsds1", template_params = pars)
flex(template = "rsds1", template_params = , storyboard = TRUE)
```

## Development status

Future updates to `snapflex` will include an expanded array of SNAP flexdashboard templates.
