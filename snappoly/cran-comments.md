## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE.

Package installed size is 26.8Mb. This is a data package that is relatively static. It will not be updated often.

NOTE that this is also the first CRAN submission for snappoly.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of snappoly 
(https://github.com/leonawicz/snappoly/blob/master/revdep/checks.txt). 
All packages passed.
