\title{Filter data frame based on plot brush}
\usage{
brushed_ts(data, x, brush, type = "annual")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame.}

\item{x}{x coordinates. See details.}

\item{brush}{brushed coordinates. See details.}

\item{type}{character, \code{"annual"} or \code{"decadal"}.}
}
\value{
a data frame.
}
\description{
This function filters data frame rows to a subset corresponding to observations included in the brushed region of a plot.
}
\details{
This implementation is for brushing restricted to the x-axis and to two types of data frames.
The annual type handles continuous x-axis data and expects a data frame with a\code{Year} column that is x-variable.
The decadal type handles categorical x-axis data and expects a \code{Decade} column that is the x-variable.
\code{x} and \code{brush} are commonly reactive values in \code{server.R}, storing the observed click and brush coordinates in \code{input},
rather than the \code{input} objects directly.
