}
\arguments{
\item{in_dir}{character, input directory.}

\item{prefix}{character, optional prefix.}

\item{bkt}{S3 bucket name, defaults to the author since this is a SNAP developer package.}

\item{pattern}{file name pattern passed to \code{list.files} for filtering files in \code{in_dir}.}

\item{region_group}{region group used to further filter files in \code{in_dir}.}

\item{mc.cores}{number of CPUs when processing years in parallel. Defaults to 32 assuming Atlas compute node context.}

\description{
Upload prepared SNAP data to Amazon Web Services S3 buckets.
}
\details{
This function uploads SNAP data to S3 buckets for use primarily by SNAP Shiny apps.
The files uploaded includes any recursively listed under \code{in_dir}. The names will include only the base names.
A \code{prefix} can be placed before the file base names. Using \code{/} in the prefix allows for the simulation of folders in the S3 bucket.
Remember that S3 buckets technically have a flat structure.

NOTE: This function will not work unless the AWS keys granting permission to the bucket are loaded into the R session.
