\item{toast_type}{if \code{type = "toast"}, the toast background color is set by specifying one of \code{"info"} (default),
\code{"success"}, \code{"warning"} or \code{"error"}.}

\item{heading_size}{character, wrap the title in html heading tags, defaults to \code{"h2"}.}

\item{toast_args}{a list of additional arguments (after \code{title} and \code{message}) to pass to \code{shinytoastr::toast_*}.}

\description{
Show information about an app during launch such as a 'welcome/what to do' toast message.
}
\details{
The list \code{toast_args} has the following defaults: \code{timeOut = 10000}, \code{extendedTimeOut = timeOut}, \code{position = "top-center"},
\code{closeButton = TRUE} and \code{preventDuplicates=TRUE}.
If another list is provided, but does not include some of these five arguments, they will
be retained as defaults. Note that this function depends heavily on associated custom CSS. For example, if your message body is
very large, it will not fit in the toast box unless additional css overrides are included in your app for size and position.
