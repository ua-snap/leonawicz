### Marginal distributions

The tables below provide aggregate information by TDD threshold and year.
Means, standard deviations, and order statistics are computed using all grid cells across all ecoregions for each combination of threshold and year.
These are annual threshold-specific spatial distributions of TDD integrated across ecoregions.
This means that all ecoregions have been pooled.
Each ecoregion's influence on the marginal spatial distribution is proportional to its size.
