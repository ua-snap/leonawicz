### Marginal distributions

The tables below provide aggregate information by TDD threshold and ecoregion.
Means, standard deviations, and order statistics are computed using all grid cells and all years for each combination of threshold and ecoregion.
These are threshold- and ecoregion-specific spatial distributions of TDD integrated across time.
