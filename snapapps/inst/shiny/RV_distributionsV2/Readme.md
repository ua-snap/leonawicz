This Shiny app draws random samples from a number of different probability distributions and plots the samples and associated `plotmath` formulas using
base R functions.

This app is part two in a four-part series showing various ways of adding some complexity to an app over the course of development. The series of apps was made in early 2013 when Shiny was in alpha and many features were not available or relatively difficult to implement. This example app is included in `snapapps` as a legacy app. Although this app has been maintained over time as Shiny has continued to develop (e.g., incorporating the transition to Bootstrap 3), the app should not be used to infer best practices, coding styles, or currently available Shiny resources or capabilities.

For a simpler, cleaner and more modern example, try `snapp("rv")`.
