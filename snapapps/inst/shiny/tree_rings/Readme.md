This Shiny app displays plots of bootstrapped, 50-year moving average correlations between tree growth and both temperature and precipitation at various sites.
It is an example of a simple app, nothing more than a data set, an input selection menu to choose data to plot, abd a plot output.
It also provides options to download the plot in either pdf or png format.
