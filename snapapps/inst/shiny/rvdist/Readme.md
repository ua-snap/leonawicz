This Shiny app draws random samples from a number of different discrete and continuous probability distributions based on your specified distribution parameters using (almost entirely) base R functions. The plots are made with `ggplot2` and associated formulas for the mass functions and density functions use R `plotmath` expressions.

This app is a 2017 revision and simplification of the early 2013 random variables versions 1 - 4 apps series. These curious can explore these legacy apps with `snapp("rv1")` through `snapp("rv4")`.
